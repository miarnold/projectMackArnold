  |**Project Overview**|| |
  ||Which planned functionality has been met? | most of it is met, have some tweaking to do with generating the schedule |
  || What planned functionality has not been met? | creating the schedule |
  ||Describe the GitHub history and what it demonstrates about the project progress during the semester.| commits are normal and everything looks good. its up to date in github. |
  ||Describe how peer and instructor feedback/recommendations were incorporated into the project.| he listened well and made mistakes we all gave him as things came up |
  ||Other comments/notes?| looks great, getting close to the end |
  |**JSPs**|| |
  ||Evaluate the JSPs for templating, business logic, data validation, overall look and feel.| used bootstrap and the site looks great |
  ||Other comments/notes?| none |
  |**Java code quality**|Evaluate the code quality for the following and identify specific areas for improvement (class, method or line number) <li>single-purpose methods <li>well-structured project <li>descriptive naming of packages, classes, methods, variables <li>classes appropriately-sized  (no monster classes) <li> CPD (copy paste detection, meaning are the same lines of code repeated?) <li>are there candidates for super/subclass relationships, abstract classes, interfaces? <li>are any values hard-coded that should be in a properties file? <li>proper exception handling <li>proper error reporting to the user <li> code documentation | |Other comments/notes?|  |
  |**Logging**|Evaluate the use of logging, for example:<li>appropriate use of logging statements in the code for error logging and debugging <li>logging levels used - info, debug, error <li> no occurrences of  System.out.printlns or printStackTrace() <li> logging works on AWS deploy|there is logging in the right place, but you said that once you fixed something you took out the logs, so there's not as much as i expected|Other comments/notes?| 
  |**Unit Tests**|Evaluate the unit tests, for example: <li>tests are truly a unit test rather than a high level functional test <li>test data is appropriately cleaned up or handled <li> there is full coverage of methods that perform business logic or utility functions <li>redundant code is eliminated by using set up and tear down methods, i.e., @Before, @After|everything is tested, and you made it weasy by using the generic dao so testing wasnt nearly as bad as doing it with seprerate daos. great work||
