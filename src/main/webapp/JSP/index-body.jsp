    <h1>Welcome to Commuters Relief!</h1>
    <h2>Goals of this website...</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I needed a project idea for my Enterprise java class</li>
        <li>I thought it would be a fun idea to make a site where you enter all this information
        and it would do all the calculations for you and send it off to someone in relevance. Hence why I made a
        commuting website that calculates how much you should be getting paid for when you go on long trips.</li>
        <li>I wanted to create a fully functional website that accomplishes what I said in 2. (self goal)(it didn't happen)</li>
        <li>I wanted to create something that I could show off if I had to go and apply for developing jobs, that aint happening.</li>
        <li>finally I wanted this site to look nice for the final presentation and have it fully working, but there are many flaws im still working on
        but hope to get done in the future after the class</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Dont you think this is the worst Index you have ever seen by a almost graduated Web Developer</p>
